As a fun project for you to wrap up this course one, I invite you to make a movies website using some of the knowledge you got here. I'll hand you some designs (made by the amazing designer [Alex Danielson][alex]) but feel free to invent your own and/or add new features beyond what we're showing here. This would be an awesome place to try out data visualization as well.

The site we have designs for is ReelingIt, a movie info perusing site. You may need to acquire your own photo assets as I didn't want to include copyrighted material in this course.
