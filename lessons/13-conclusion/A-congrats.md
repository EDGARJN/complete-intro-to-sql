You did it!

Congratulations, you are well on your way to being an expert at SQL and PostgreSQL. Some final thoughts for you on what you learned today.

- _Most_ of what you learned today is applicable to \_any SQL database: MySQL, Oracle, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server, etc. SQL is a general spec that all of these database then take and put their own flavor on. Many of these queries will work as-is on a different database. The rest have to be tweaked slightly to fit the other database's flavor. But all the principles you learned apply.
- This course focused exclusively on how to query a database and was generally focused from a programmer's perspective and _not_ an operations perspective. Notice we didn't talk about replication, configuring a server, deploying, backing up, replication, etc. This is a course for another time (and another teacher!) This was to teach you about basic querying skills.
- We also didn't cover ORMs for Node.js. In general I've had more problems then time saved with using ORMs. I always want to have access to the underlying SQL at the end of the day. I normally need that control.

Great job again! I hope you enjoyed the course! Please [tweet at me][tweet] what you thought and [give this repo a star][repo]!
